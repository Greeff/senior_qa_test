Python has and is my main scripting language, it is something that I have been using for a few years which Im comfortable with and not have a reason to take up a different language since. Without selenium web driver, this test script wouldn’t be possible since it is heavily based on browser testing, elements is required in order to run the test.  

With using TDD structure, I felt that it free’d up a lot of time for me and focus on writing up the test functions and allowed for a better working environment for me, it is easy to read and locate items. 

There were other options in writing my script and initially I wanted to use Cucumber and run my test in BDD though I found that I had to create several other scripts and having to import each file in order to run the tests which was much more time consuming. 
Therefore, I kept the Gherkin script and used that as a reference in writing my test script. Using a ‘class’ with separate ‘definitions’ kept the tests separated, again a method that I like to use which allows me to read and locate things easily.
