# Currencycloud-Tech-Test


## Scenario:

A new Payments API has been delivered. This API allows users to create new payment records, amend details after submission, search for existing payments, and delete payment records as required. The API returns JSON responses and performs error handling in the event of an invalid request taking place.

## Acceptance Criteria:

You are required to develop the user journies in Cucumber, using a language of your choice (Ruby is preferable to us), which will:
- Perform User Login and retrieve a login token
- Create a quote for Selling GBP and buying USD using the sell side
- Verify the buy amount is correct to the rate 
- Create another quote but perform a negative assertion 
- End the API Session

We will be looking for how you implement the API calls within your code, using OOP. We will also be considering your usuage of best practices, config files and storing information for further steps. 

## Deliverable:

Before starting the test create a new branch on this repository with an initial commit. Make your changes, commit them to your branch and then create a PR for review. Your PR MUST include a README.MD file that will have clear instructions on how to set up your framework along with how to run the tests. Please include the reasoning behind your tech choices.
